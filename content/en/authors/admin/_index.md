## About Me

I am a first-year master’s student in Scientific Programming at RUDN. Programming for me is not just about studies; it’s a true passion. I’m always eager to develop myself and expand my knowledge by exploring new technologies and approaches. I enjoy tackling complex problems, finding unconventional solutions, and working with others who share my interest in innovation.
