**How to Properly Format a Report: Simple Tips for Perfect Results**

Formatting a report is like gift wrapping: even the most valuable information can look unconvincing if the “packaging” leaves much to be desired. Want your report to make a good impression on your teacher or colleagues? Then follow these simple formatting rules.

#### 1. Title Page: Creating the First Impression

The title page is the face of your report. Here’s what it should include:
- The name of the organization or institution where you’re doing the work.
- The report title and topic.
- Your full name, position, or class group.
- The name and surname of the supervisor (teacher or mentor) reviewing the report.
- The date of completion.

💡 *Tip*: Ensure the title page looks clean and neat, without unnecessary information. Use a formal style.

#### 2. Table of Contents: Order Comes First

A table of contents makes the report easy to read and reveals its structure at a glance. List all sections and subsections with their page numbers. It’s especially convenient to create an automatic table of contents, as it stays up-to-date with any text changes.

💡 *Tip*: Follow a consistent numbering system, such as 1, 1.1, 1.2 for chapters and subsections.

#### 3. Main Body: Clear Structure is Key

The main body of the report should include several essential elements:
- **Introduction**. Explain why you’re writing the report, its objectives, tasks, and relevance.
- **Main Sections**. Divide the content into logical parts, stick to the topic, and maintain order. Don’t forget numbering and headings.
- **Conclusion**. Summarize and conclude: did you achieve your goals, and what results did you reach?

💡 *Tip*: Structure the text into paragraphs and break up large text blocks. Highlight key points in bold or italics, but avoid overloading the text.

#### 4. References: Don’t Forget Your Sources

A reference list is an essential part of any report, especially if you cite other works or use statistics and studies. References should follow a standard (such as APA or MLA), which is usually required.

💡 *Tip*: Add sources to the list as you mention them in the text. This will simplify the work at the final stage.

#### 5. Appendices: For Those Who Want More Details

Appendices are for materials that help to understand the content but clutter the main part (like charts, tables, diagrams). Include them at the end with headings and captions.

#### 6. Formatting: Make Your Text Look Professional

Ensure your text looks neat:
- **Font**: Typically Times New Roman, size 12–14.
- **Line Spacing**: 1.5.
- **Margins**: Left 3 cm, right 1.5 cm, top and bottom 2 cm.
- **Page Numbering**: Preferably at the bottom, centered or on the right.

💡 *Tip*: Check alignment and make sure text doesn’t go beyond the margins.

#### 7. Tables and Figures: For Visual Clarity

If your report includes tables or figures, remember to number and caption them. Place them near their reference in the text. This helps readers find the information you’re referring to right away.

💡 *Tip*: Ensure each image or table fits logically into the text and doesn’t feel “out of place.”

#### Conclusion

By following these rules, you’ll create a report that’s pleasant and easy to read. A well-formatted report shows that you took the task seriously, which is half the battle!
